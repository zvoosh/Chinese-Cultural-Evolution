                    Xieyi (写意画) is a style of traditional Chinese painting that can be translated as "freehand" or "sketching the idea." It is characterized by a spontaneous and expressive approach to brushwork, focusing on capturing the essence and spirit of the subject rather than producing a realistic representation. Xieyi emphasizes the artist's feelings, emotions, and individual interpretation.
