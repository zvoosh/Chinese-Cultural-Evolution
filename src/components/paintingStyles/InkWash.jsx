                        <span className="bold"> Materials and Techniques: </span>The primary medium used in Ink and Wash Painting is Chinese ink, which is typically made from soot, water, and glue. The ink is applied with a brush made of animal hair, often attached to a bamboo handle.
                        Traditional Chinese paintings are often created on rice paper or silk. These materials absorb the ink in a unique way, allowing for a range of expressive brushstrokes.
