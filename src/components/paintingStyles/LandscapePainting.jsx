                        <span className="bold">Philosophical Foundations: </span>
                        Landscape painting in China is deeply rooted in Daoist and Confucian philosophies. Daoism emphasizes harmony with nature, while Confucianism values moral integrity and the cultivation of virtue. Chinese landscape painting often seeks to express the interconnectedness between humanity and the natural world.
                        <span className="bold">Three Perfections (Sanjue 三绝): </span>Chinese landscape painting is often associated with the "Three Perfections" – poetry, calligraphy, and painting. Artists who excelled in all three were highly esteemed. Many landscape paintings include poetic inscriptions and calligraphy alongside the visual depiction.

                        <span className="bold"> Ink and Wash Technique: </span>The use of ink and wash is a defining characteristic of Chinese landscape painting. Artists use black ink made from soot and water, applied with a brush on absorbent paper or silk. The wash technique involves diluting the ink to create various shades and textures, capturing the essence of mountains, rivers, and other natural elements.

                        <span className="bold">Elements of Composition: </span>Chinese landscape paintings often adhere to compositional conventions. The "three perfections" (mountains, water, and sky) are essential components. The use of diagonal lines, atmospheric perspective, and the placement of elements to create a harmonious balance are also key considerations.

                        <span className="bold">Depiction of Mountains and Water: </span>Mountains and water are recurring themes in Chinese landscape painting, representing enduring and dynamic forces in nature.

Their paintings often conveyed personal sentiments, emotions, and philosophical reflections.
